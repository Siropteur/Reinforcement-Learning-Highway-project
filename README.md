# Reinforcement-Learning-Highway-project
University project on the subject of reinforcement learning, in collaboration with [Médéric PENIGUEL](https://github.com/MedericP9).

## Overview
This project is part of our initiative to deepen our understanding of reinforcement learning (RL) by applying the theoretical knowledge gained during our courses. Our primary goal is to learn through hands-on experience and bridge the gap between theory and practice.\
To realize that, we will work on the [highway-env](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/HighwayEnv/tree/master)

## Objectives
- **Deepen Knowledge**: Explore and implement key concepts of reinforcement learning.
- **Skill Enhancement**: Gain proficiency in RL frameworks and libraries, such as Gymnasium and StableBaseline.

## Team
We are a team of two dedicated students passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, aiming to leverage this project to enhance our expertise in RL.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gymnasium
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive understanding of reinforcement learning concepts and techniques.
- A well-documented repository showcasing our learning process, code, and results.
- Insights into the challenges and solutions encountered during RL model development.
